Project Name: Node.js and Express.js with PostgreSQL

Description:
This project is a Node.js and Express.js application that demonstrates how to integrate PostgreSQL as the database without using any ORM.
It provides a basic structure for setting up a RESTful API with CRUD operations. And implements every operation using SQL queries.

I tried to use a minimal amount of middleware and node modules namely -

    1. pg (npm package for PostgreSQL client)
    2. ExpressJS (middleware)
    3. nodemon (dev dependency)
